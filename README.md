# AMERICAN OPTION PRICING IN A JUMP-DIFFUSION MODEL

## Abstract from 2008 Thesis

Many alternative models have been developed lately to generalize the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model in order to incorporate more empirical features. Brownian motion
and normal distribution have been used in this Black-Scholes option-pricing framework to
model the return of assets. However, two main points emerge from empirical investigations:
(i) the leptokurtic feature that describes the return distribution of assets as having a
higher peak and two asymmetric heavier tails than those of the normal distribution,
and (ii) an empirical phenomenon called "volatility smile" in option markets. Among
the recent models that addressed the aforementioned issues is that of Kou (2002), which
allows the price of the underlying asset to move according to both Brownian increments
and double-exponential jumps. The aim of this thesis is to develop an analytic pricing
expression for American options in this model that enables us to efficiently determine both
the price and related hedging parameters.
